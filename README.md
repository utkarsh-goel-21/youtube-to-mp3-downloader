# YouTube to MP3 Downloader ðŸŽ§

This is a simple Python-based project that allows you to download audio from YouTube videos and save it as MP3 files.

It uses the `yt-dlp` library to fetch the video and `ffmpeg` to convert the audio to MP3 format.

## How it works

1. You enter a YouTube video URL.
2. The script downloads the best quality audio available.
3. It then converts the downloaded audio to MP3 using ffmpeg.
